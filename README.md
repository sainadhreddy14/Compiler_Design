# Compiler Design Programs

This repository contains compiler design lab programs including Lex, Yacc, and C implementations. The programs are organized into two folders:

## 1. Lab-Programs

Compiler design programs for various tasks including lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.

| Program Name | Description | Link |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| Program1.l   | Identifies valid identifiers in input. | [Lab-Programs/Program1.l](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program1.l) |
| Program2.l   | Recognizes C keywords. | [Lab-Programs/Program2.l](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program2.l) |
| Program3.l   | Classifies operators (arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment). | [Lab-Programs/Program3.l](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program3.ll) |
| Program4.l   | Identifies constants, comments, identifiers, and operators in C.  | [Lab-Programs/Program4.l](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program4.l) |
| Program5.l   | Distinguishes vowels and consonants. | [Lab-Programs/Program5.l](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program5.l)  |
| Program6.l   | Identifies functions and comments in C.  | [Lab-Programs/Program6.l](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program6.l)  |
| Program7.c   | Top-Down parsing using backtracking (brute force) method for a given grammar.  | [Lab-Programs/Program7.c](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program7.l)  |
| Program8.c   | Recursive descent parser with lookahead for arithmetic expressions. | [Lab-Programs/Program8.c](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program8.c)  |
| Program9.c   | Recursive descent parser with lookahead for parsing expressions with lists and parentheses. | [Lab-Programs/Program9.c](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program9.c)  |
| Program10.c  | Computes FIRST sets for each non-terminal in a grammar. | [Lab-Programs/Program10.c](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program10.c)  |
| Program11.l  | Counts the number of words and lines in a given file or program. | [Lab-Programs/Program11.l](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program11.l)  |
| Program12.y  | Yacc calculator that evaluates arithmetic expressions with addition and multiplication (includes built-in yylex function). | [Lab-Programs/Program12.y]([Lab-Programs/Program12.y](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program12.l))  |
| Program13    | Yacc calculator with separate Lex file (Program13.l and Program13.y) for evaluating arithmetic expressions with addition and multiplication. | [Lab-Programs/Program13/](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/tree/main/Lab_programs/Program13)  |
| Program14    | YACC top-down parser with Lex file (Program14.l and Program14.y) for validating arithmetic expressions using grammar after eliminating left recursion. | [Lab-Programs/Program14/](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/tree/main/Lab_programs/Program14)  |
| Program15.c  | Lexical analyzer implementation in C that reads from a file and identifies keywords, identifiers, operators, and numbers. | [Lab-Programs/Program15.c](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program15.c)  |
| Program16.c  | Computes FOLLOW sets for non-terminals in a grammar. The FOLLOW set contains terminal symbols that can appear immediately after a non-terminal. | [Lab-Programs/Program16.c](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program16.c)  |
| Program17.c  | Implements stack allocation strategy for compilers, simulating activation record stack management for function calls and returns. | [Lab-Programs/Program17.c](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Lab_programs/program17.c)  |

## 2. Assignment-Programs

Additional Lex programs for assignments.

| Program Name | Description | Link |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| Program1.l   | Assignment program for identifier recognition. | [Assignment-Programs/Program1.l](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Assignment_programs/program1.l) |
| Program2.l   | Assignment program for recognizing various representations of real numbers in programming languages. | [Assignment-Programs/Program2.l](https://github.com/sainadhreddy14/Compiler_Design/blob/main/Assignment_programs/program2.l) |
